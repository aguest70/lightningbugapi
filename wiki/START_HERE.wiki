= What's new? =
 * The API as been redesigned. The `BugzillaClient` is no longer used to query product(s) an bugs. These tasks are now performed by the `ProductService` and the `BugService` according to  the [http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/4.0/en/html/api/Bugzilla/WebService.html Bugzilla Web Service].
 * A feature called [local_cache Local Cache] will store the products configuration of a Bugzilla instance on the client. The second attempt to connect the client and query product information will use the locally stored information and significantly speed up the query
 * The creation of bugs has been temporarily disabled an will be supported again in the next version
